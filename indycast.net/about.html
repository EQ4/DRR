<p>Indycast is a set of federated servers controlled by a community for time-shifting independent radio.</p>

<p>I've been a listener and supporter of non-commercial radio for about 20 years.</p>

<p>In that time, I've found a few things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Often the best shows are on at inconvenient hours</li>
  <li>These shows are rarely archived</li>
  <li>When the shows are archived, they have the following properties
    <ul>
      <li>I need itunes, which I don't have</li>
      <li>They break the show down into small units that must be reconstituted manually</li>
      <li>You have to know every show and stations individual site</li>
      <li>The retention policy of the audio and when it is availabe widely varies</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>However, they all have internet streams that you can listen to wherever.</p>

<p>So a few years ago I made a shell-scripted solution for this.  cron would fire off a downloader at the time my show was on, the downloader would time-stamp the web stream and dump it in a directory and then I can listen to it later.</p>

<p>This worked fine. For years actually.  But it was so useful I wanted to share this with everyone</p>

<p>So I had to make a system that everyone could use.</p>

<h2>Designing something for everyone</h2>

<p>I made a few decisions to set up the framework of the system early on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Non-commercial - I wanted a way to support and provide listener supported radio in a convenient manner</li>
  <li>Free - Although I'm just building a platform, it didn't feel right charging people for this so it had to be free</li>
  <li>Distributed - The architecture has to allow people from other places with their own stations to join the network without much effort</li>
  <li>Open source and hackable - Every device and reasonable way of listening to content should be supported</li>
</ul>

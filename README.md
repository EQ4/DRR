Indycast **Radio** Recorder

This is the source code for [indycast.net](http://indycast.net).  

Indycast is a federation of servers which records radio streams for later listening on a per-person basis through the use of custom-generated podcasts.

The servers for indycast are independently maintained by volunteers.

Indycast **Radio** Recorder

This is the source code for [indycast.net](indycast.net).  

Indycast is a federation of servers which records radio streams for later listening on a per-person basis through the use of custom-generated podcasts.

The servers for indycast are independently maintained by volunteers.

## Notes

  callsign/ISO8601_UTC/duration_in_minutes

ex:
  kxlu/2015-06-16T20:00:00/60

  And you'll get the appropriate content-type and file.

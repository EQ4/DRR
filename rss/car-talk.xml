      <title>#1526: Mama Was a Race Car Driver</title>
      <description><![CDATA[This week on The Best of Car Talk, Ben is scared to death to ride with his mom. She used to drive race cars, and still likes to treat Main Street as if it was Le Mans.

Elsewhere, Aaron thinks his Toyota is haunted by the spirit of Maurice Chevalier; Jamie wants to achieve his life's ambition of owning a vehicle with power steering; and, Kristina's truck is backfiring so loudly, everyone in 500-foot radius ducks and covers. Also, how could three drops of soda burn an Accord's leather seat? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.]]></description>

[Indycast](http://indycast.net) is a DVR for independent radio. 

You can use it to transform a broadcast into a podcast for later listening.

Stations are supported through the generosity of a volunteer network of servers around the world.

You can help by

 * [Fixing bugs in the software](https://github.com/kristopolous/DRR/issues)
 * [Giving us money](https://github.com/kristopolous/DRR/wiki/Donating-Money)
 * [Running a server](https://github.com/kristopolous/DRR/wiki/Join-the-Federation)
 * [Giving us an account on an existing server](https://github.com/kristopolous/DRR/wiki/Donating-Servers).

Thanks for your interest!
